Spoofs association requests to tamper with contact tracing data over WIFI

sniff_associate.py - This file is the main file of the program. It sniffs probe requests and then generates spoofed associations to the proper access point.  It then outputs the necessary data for WifiTrace.

csvtest.py - Takes the data generated by sniff_associate.py and formats it properly for WifiTrace.

output.csv - A sample input file for WifiTrace.

macsniffer.py
wifi.py

The above two files are library files used by other components of the program.
